#+title: GFXUI-js

A minimal geometry editing UI for Canvas, with an "immediate mode" programming interface.
This is losely a javascript port of code I previosuly developed for C++: [[https://github.com/colormotor/gfx_ui]].

- Basic point and handle dragging
- Manipulating affine transforms
- Rect selection
- Icon toolbars

A demo and example code (in page source) can be found here: https://colormotor.github.io/gfxui-js/
